# element: the second block parameter, number in this case, is the current element of the array.
# The reduce method returns the final value of the accumulator.
# The result of the block is stored in the accumulator and then passed to the next iteration of the block. THe accululator is also the value that the reduce method returns at the end.By default, the accumulator is the first element of the array. So, for each step of the iteration, we would have the following:
# 1. Iteration 0: sum = 5+6 = 11
# 2. Iteration 1: sum = 11+7 = 18
# 3. Iteration 2: sum = 18+8 = 26

# We can also set a default initial value for the accumulator.
